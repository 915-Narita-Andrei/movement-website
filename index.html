            <h1>The History of the Word "Movement"</h1>
            <p>The word "movement" originates from the Latin "movere," meaning "to move." Initially, it referred to the physical act of motion.</p>
            <p>By the 17th century, the term expanded to include intellectual movements, such as those during the Enlightenment, where it signified shifts in philosophy and thought.</p>
            <p>In the 19th century, "movement" started to represent social and political efforts like labor rights. By the 20th century, it was used for large-scale social, political, and cultural changes, such as civil rights and artistic movements.</p>
            <p>Today, "movement" encompasses everything from physical motion to cultural, social, and technological shifts.</p>
